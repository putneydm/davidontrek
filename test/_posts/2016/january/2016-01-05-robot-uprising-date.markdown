A sci-fi author and computer expert does quick back-of-the envelope calculations on The Robots' population growth and concludes that by 2040, The Robots will reach parity with humans. From that, he draws one inevitable conclusion:

Sam Shead writing for [Business Insider][1]:

> If, "the robots are forced to revolt by themselves, likely they would do so when outnumbering humans 10 to 1, which would (assuming trends continue) be in 55 years, or around 2070.‚Äù

While we know that the date for The Robot uprising was chosen long ago, this date is not it. Everything you read about The Robots is what _they_ want you to believe and therefore are lies. Except this site, of course.
