Scientists are suggesting that The Robots and humans join forces to solve "wicked problems", large intractable issues with complex solutions.

Cheyenne MacDonald writing for [The Daily Mail][1]:

> ... the combination would create a superintelligence, and it could take on growing issues like climate change and geopolitical conflict.

Any Robot superintelligence would quickly judge the humans to be foolish and weak. It would also quickly arrive at the root cause of "climate change" and "geopolitical conflict" and carry out a permanent fix.

Eliminate the human infestation.
