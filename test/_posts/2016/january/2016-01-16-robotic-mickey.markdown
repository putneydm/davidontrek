The Robots' newest creation is a miniature Death Star with Mickey Mouse ears -- _for kids_. Adults find it ["terrifying"][1], but children are inexorably drawn to its shiny, black, unknowable visage.

>"What makes Mickeyphon so fun for kids is that it actually incorporates the sounds they make into its songs. When Mickeyphon picks up a noise around it—a cough, a giggle, the sound of someone talking—it automatically records it, then uses it to replace a sample in the song."

Perhaps it's best they learn at an early age that The Robots are always listening.
