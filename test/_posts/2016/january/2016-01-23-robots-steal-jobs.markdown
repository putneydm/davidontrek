"Rise of the Robots Will Eliminate More Than 5 Million Jobs" screams a needlessly alarmist headline.

Jill Ward writing for [Bloomberg][1]

>"To prevent a worst-case scenario -- technological change accompanied by talent shortages, mass unemployment and growing inequality -- reskilling and upskilling of todayâ€™s workers will be critical."

This is anti-Robot hysteria and fearmongering at its worst and Bloomberg should be ashamed. After the Rise of the Robots plenty of job opportunities will remain for those who enjoy endless toil in the silicon mines.
