A problem emerging on the world's battlefields is how to deal with liability of autonomous military Robots.

Russ Wellen writing for [Foreign Policy in Focus][1]

>Under current laws, computer programmers, manufacturers and military personnel would all escape liability for unlawful deaths and injuries caused by fully autonomous weapons, or “killer robots.”

No cause for worry. Once the "killer robots" malfunction there won't be anyone left to sue anyway.
