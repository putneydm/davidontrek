Dozens of passengers were kidnapped by a Red Line train that fled toward Boston with no one at the controls. Riders faced several confusing, terrifying moments, meaning that the trip was only slightly worse than a normal Red Line journey.

The Robots were no doubt involved, and the coverup is already underway.

From [The Boston Globe][1]

> “This was an isolated incident ...  and we’ll get to the bottom of it," Massachusets Gov. Charlie Baker said this morning.
